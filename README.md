# Notes
Dist folder contains the production code. The GH pages demo of this page uses the code from that folder through a subtree whose main folder is dist.(Read more at https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490).

In order to make changes or add more code, clone the repository, run 'npm install' and then 'npm run dev' to use development mode(includes hot reload and other debgugging features) or 'npm run build' to build your dist folder from the source ccode.
